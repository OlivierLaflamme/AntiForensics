I was wondering how do you stop your malware from being acquired and analyzed. Basically tools like rekal are kinda good so normally if its in memory you do an aquisition in memory and its gg. And if you have a ram image its gg... right? 

The scene is this: Im an attacker and ive got malware running on a system im 1337 so im performing some magic in my malware to prevent it from being aquired and analyzed. 

So.... the goal is to try and analyze my "malware"

1. Try to aquire memory 
2. Try and get the source 


If you do DM me on twitter and ill transfer the 1st 3 people some DOGE/SHIBA. 


The "malware" literally does nothing it just hangs so you can get it from memory
